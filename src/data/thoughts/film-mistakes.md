*A list I fully expect to expand on as we go along*

1. If you're coming back to film photography after a long layoff, there's a non-zero chance that there's still film in the camera. And you, fully expecting an empty camera, will open the camera back and expose the film to light. Fortunately, you can tell - *apparently*, if the rewind knob moves when you use the advancer, there's film in there. But of course you didn't know this beforehand. 
2. You will mess around with your old cameras, turning each and every dial - while there was film in the camera. Now your ISO settings are a mess and you don't know what ISO film is in the camera 
3. After exposing your film to light accidentally, you think to yourself, "NBD, I'll rewind the film all the way back and shoot it from the beginning". Now, why you decided to do this is not known. Of course, you forget that *there's a rewind button*, and *something feels stuck* - and before you know it, there's a tearing sound. Your advance and rewind were fighting and the film lost, and now there are tears in the sprockets
