New year, new site.

A lot happened in 2025. 

1. Finished culinary school
2. Quit culinary dreams, went back to webdev
3. Listened to a lot of prog metal and samurai trap (?)
4. Got obsessed about retro handhelds, bought an RP5. It barely runs Switch/PC games, so I got jaded with the hobby
5. Am now thinking of dipping my toes into photography (again)
