I've been baking sourdough for a short time now - I'm coming up on my 13th loaf. And, I find that, if I limit myself to the basics, I can usually get a loaf with a decent crumb. But I wasn't content with my results. So, I turned to Reddit:

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="240"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/h8yypk/comment/futmxim/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antc1986/">u/antc1986</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/h8yypk/any_tips_to_get_a_more_airy_crumb/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/">Sourdough</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

More hydration == more holes.

But, after baking other loaves (that are not sourdough), I started wondering if this was truly the case. Why wasn't I getting similar results with other high-hydration recipes? Was there something special about sourdough?

Surely I was doing something wrong. Thus, I did a little more research. It seems that an airy crumb is caused by a multitude of things:

1. Being gentle with the dough. We don't want to push out all the bubbles created by fermentation (this means no degassing!)
2. Allowing the dough to ferment for an appropriate amount of time. How long is long enough? There are several signs that point to a nicely fermented dough:
   - Smooth surface
   - The presence of a "domed" shape
   - The dough should be jiggly
3. Proper shaping

With that in mind (and time on my hands), I baked a loaf of sourdough. Nicest crumb I've achieved, thus far. I decided to try the same techniques with a slow-yeasted bread - and got similar results (but not quite as nice - it's something I'll have to look into).
