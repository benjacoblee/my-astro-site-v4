Quick likes/dislikes of Nuxt:

**Likes**

- Opinionated and thus allows magic
- Somewhat intuitive
- Doesn't seem overly complex 

**Dislikes**

- Magic, lots and lots of magic. It works till it doesn't
- Documentation can be better. Doesn't explain that `e` has a `.data` property because of `ofetch`, etc.
- I wish the directory structure was more obvious
