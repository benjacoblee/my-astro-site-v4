I know Jim Wendler is a highly-regarded dude in the lifting scene, but I was thinking about my run with BtM - and I don't think it's a "smart" program to run. 

First of all, 5x5 rep schemes kind of suck. You're recommended to start **light** so you have a runway as the weeks progress. Problem is, the early weeks end up ridiculously easy, with some of the sets being nothing more than warm up sets. And by the time the **big** week comes, it's too heavy. If the point was to "get some touches on the bar", I'd prefer to see a 4x5, 1xAMRAP. 

The diet is rly dumb. Like, rly rly dumb. 

> [...] and that means EATING right. I had 4 people run this and all of them ate like champions – all ate at least 1.5 pound of ground beef a day and ate one dozen whole eggs a day. That’s the only thing I required via diet.

Maybe this would work for athletes - and semi-pros - but I don't see how you could eat like this without getting fat, even if you were doing the conditioning everyday. We're not all 200-lb football players...

Two good things I will say about BtM:

1. If you just wanna show up and lift shit, it's decent
2. Your work capacity _will_ improve. Since you're doing so many reps, there's just no way around it
