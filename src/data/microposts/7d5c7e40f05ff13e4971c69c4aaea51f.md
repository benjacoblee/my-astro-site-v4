An excerpt from "Metaprogramming Ruby":

> “I am still confused, Master,” said the disciple, even more worried than before.
“They always taught me that self-modifying code is bad. How will I know that
I am wielding this art properly?”
> [...] The master began to get annoyed. “You’re smart enough to learn,” he said,
“but are you smart enough to forget what you have learned? There’s no such
thing as metaprogramming. It’s just programming all the way through. Now
get lost, and let me meditate in peace.”

LOL
