I saw a list of "10 JS frameworks in 2025" on Reddit and decided to look into some of them. 

- **Drizzle (ORM)** - easy enough to set up. Seems relatively straightforward and intuitive
- **Biome (linter/formatter, Prettier replacement)** - TODO
- **Bun (all-in-one toolkit thingamabob)** - finally got around to trying it. Don't know what the advantages are over NodeJS, though. Supposedly faster, I wouldn't know. Supports Typescript out of the box, but you can do that with the latest Node version as well (both just do type-stripping)  
- **Deno (runtime)** - TODO 
- **Zustand (state management)** - TODO
- **Hono (web framework)** - like express but with some QOL stuff? You can write code in a .jsx file and send JSX as a response. Is nice
- **HTMX (reactivity with server-sent HTML fragments? idk)** - TODO
- **Shadcn (styled components)** - TODO
