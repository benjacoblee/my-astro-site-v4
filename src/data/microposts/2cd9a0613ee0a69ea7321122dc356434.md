You know, you'd think that a community that revolves around a concept like "cozy gaming" would be wholesome - but that's not always the case. Some people are especially precious of certain IP. You'll hear things like "omg stardew ripoff", "wow its so much like stardew it turns me off"

But... Stardew itself is not wholly original, lol. No one says that about Harvest Moon (maybe they did back then? idk). Seeing shit like that annoys and disappoints me. Like, I just hear about good games, man
