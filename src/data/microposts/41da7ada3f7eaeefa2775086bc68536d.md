It's only been a few days, but I've gotta say, I really love my RP5. I'm getting older by the day (no shit, who isn't) and that means:

- less time for gaming 
- I can only play any given game in short bursts

And handhelds are sorta perfect for that. It's kinda sad that the industry is going in the other direction with gaming "handhelds" - that is to say, they're getting enormous. I don't know if we'll ever see a proper handheld from the likes of Sony or Nintendo again. Still, I have a lifetime's worth of retro games to go through, and I'm more than ok with that.
