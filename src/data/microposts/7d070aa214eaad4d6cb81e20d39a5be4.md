Something to try:

> Especially when the elbows fire up you have to drop the reps for a bit. I love (1,2,3)x3 in clusters. Do 1,2,3 reps with 45-60s rest between sets then take a 2-3 min break and repeat two more times. You end up getting 18 reps at a really heavy weight. Once you can complete the whole ladder add a few pounds. If it feels really heavy I may spend 2 or 3 workouts at the same weight to make more of a step cycle instead of straight linear.
