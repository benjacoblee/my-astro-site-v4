**TIL**:

- Bun + Astro seems to have some weird bug where it doesn't hot-reload a page on change. Seems to be a Vite issue? Found a fix here: [Case mismatched .astro components do not hot reload when running dev server · Issue #4419 · withastro/astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4419)
- "Notice there is a line break before the text starts in the block above. That line break **will render**, which can be highly annoying. There is no great CSS way to handle that." - [CSS Tricks on styling `pre` tags](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-pre-tag/)
- You can set custom properties, then redefine them in a different scope:

```html
<style>
	:root {
		--some-var: red;
	}

	main {
		background: var(--some-var);
	}

	main.dark {
		--some-var: pink;
	}
</style>
```
