I have had to restructure my Microposts "API" twice in the last week now.

Goddamn Telegram strips formatting from messages and saves it as "entities" (or something - I can't be bothered to work with that, or figure it out).

Also, I really regret writing the script in Go. I don't know - with Go, it's always been a love/hate thing, and it's mostly hate RN
