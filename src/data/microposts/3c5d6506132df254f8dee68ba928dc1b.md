#microposts 

Recently, I've been enjoying circuit-style workouts. I try to do some variation of Murph at least once a week. At first, I was doing them partitioned as such:

- 1.61k run
- 5/10/15 pullup/pushup/squat for 20 rounds
- 1.61k run

Today, I tried doing them like this:

- 400m run / 10 pullup / 20 pushup / 30 squat for 5 rounds
- 400m run / 5/10/15/5/10/15 pullup/pushup/squat for 5 rounds

It's fun (in a sort of grueling way, I suppose). I'd like to sprinkle more of this type of workout (shorter ones) throughout the week, perhaps with kettlebells.
