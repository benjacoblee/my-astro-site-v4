bru h i'm going through a css book and I don't rmb css being this hard 

like i guess the simple stuff is easy and the hard things are impossible

and it isn't so much like a traditional programming language in that you can "reason about things" (I'm not saying it's not a programming language - don't @ me) as it is a bunch of seemingly arbitrary rules that you have to sort of remember
