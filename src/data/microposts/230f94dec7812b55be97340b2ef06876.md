Watched Superman yesterday and I have thoughts 

- Lex Luthor shouting commands is not a vibe
- Wasn't a fan of the monologues
- Some jokes felt out of place - the show doesn't allow itself to be serious for too long
- Lois considers a break-up and changes her mind out of nowhere
- Some parts of Superman feel like an overcorrection. People seem to love the part where he saves a squirrel - I thought it was pretty "extra"
- **SPOILER**: everyone hates (or is terrified) of Superman after Lex reveals that his _true mission_ is to dominate earth. But after Lex is revealed to be a Bad Guy, people love Superman again. That doesn't really make sense, at least not to me. Lex being a bad guy doesn't exactly nullify the fact that Superman's parents wanted him to lord over earth. 

Overall I thought the film was a bit too rushed for my liking
