#microposts 

I've all but given up on Pokemon hacks. They're often imbalanced to the point of tedium, and so, try as I might, I haven't gotten any joy out of the 6-7 ones I tried over the past two weeks. I appreciate the QoL tweaks, the Fakemon, and other things, but the enforced difficulty just isn't very fun to me. Like, I just wanna chill game on the weekends, man.
