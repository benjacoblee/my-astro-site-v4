Ranking weekdays because why the hell not

1. Saturday because it's a weekend, and it's the first of two. So you can take comfort in the fact that there's more weekend to come
2. Sunday because it's a weekend, but the following day is Monday 
3. Wednesday because I know we're halfway to the weekend
4. Friday is closer to the weekend, but provides less psychological boost than Wednesday 
5. Thursday is ass
6. Tuesday is ass 
7. Monday is ass
